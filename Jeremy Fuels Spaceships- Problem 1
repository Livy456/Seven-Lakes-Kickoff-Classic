## Input Section
x = input()			## how to receive the input from problem as a string
x = x.split(" ")			## splits the input
x = [int(y) for y in x]		## converts the input into integers

amt = x[0]		## indexes 1st element to know how much fuel the spaceship requires 
del x[0]			## function to delete first element
total = 0		## initializes total, amount of fuel in spaceship
fuel = 0		## initializes fuel, number of times spaceship has to be fueled

## for loop to go through every element in the list, x
for h in x:		    
total+= h		## adds up each fuel amount
    	fuel+=1		## increase the number of times fueled by 1
    
	## checks to see if the amount of fuel needed has been exceeded
    	if total >= amt:	
       			
## prints out number of times spaceship had to be fueled before the spaceship 
## received enough fuel
print("The ship was fueled " + str(fuel) + " times. The ship has been fueled!")
        		
break		## breaks the loop
